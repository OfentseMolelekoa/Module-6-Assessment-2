                <h2>GET BEHIND THE WHEEL OF OUR CARS</h2>
                <p>

                    maximising value. We believe in complete transparency and our numerous 
                    customers will vouch for this honest approach to business. We have structured a 
                    turnkey sales experience, offering trade-in appraisal, finance arrangements, 
                    roadworthy, licensing and warranty solutions.

                    We offer you the benefit of driving away in your new car the very same day 
                    you choose it! We have accomplished this polished system by employing extremely 
                    competent staff to fulfil the various functions within the sales cycle, from the

                    <h2>EXCEPTIONAL SECOND HAND VEHICLES</h1>
                    <p>
                        Traditionally buying a used car has been a nerve-wracking experience. Stories of 
                        dubious dealers, tainted cars and lack of service have lead to the perception 
                        that one was at the mercy of bandits when dealing with anything other than a new car franchise.
                        <br>
                        We understand that the choice our customers make to place their vehicle purchase in our 
                        hands is a matter of intense trust and therefore we have positioned ourselves in a way 
                        which can fulfil the essential requirements in any vehicle purchase; our aim is to 
                        supply top quality cars, top quality service and the best value money can buy for 
                        each specific and individualised transaction. So often companies forget that the 
                        process of buying a new car is often the most expensive purchase made after buying 
                        a home and our aim is to safeguard you during this decision making process.
                    </p>
