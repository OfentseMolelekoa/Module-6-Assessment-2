                        <li>
                            The auctions are subject to a right to bid by or on behalf of AUTO4SALE. These Rules of Auction comply 
                            with section 45 of the Consumer Protection Act, Act 68 of 2008 (“the Act”) and the Regulations of the Act.

                        <li>
                            Each vehicle is, unless there is evidence to the contrary, regarded to be the subject of a separate transaction.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The reason for the auction is the normal and voluntary disposal of the vehicle by AUTO4SALE.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            AUTO4SALE will take no responsibility for any interruption in internet connection resulting in t
                            he Buyer being disconnected from the auction, be it the Buyer's or AUTO4SALE internet connection, 
                            for any reason whatsoever, including the loss of a potential purchase, should the bid not be recorded 
                            due to the system disconnecting.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            AUTO4SALE may at any time, at its discretion, decide to accept an offer made by a Buyer, 
                            to purchase a vehicle as advertised for auction, before the auction commences. 
                            The relevant vehicle will then be withdrawn from the auction.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The Buyer will arrange for the removal of the purchased vehicle at the time 
                            indicated by AUTO4SALE. Should the Buyer fail to take delivery of the vehicle, 
                            AUTO4SALE will be entitled to charge the Buyer a removal fee, storage fees,

                            The auctioneer reserves the right, in his/ her sole discretion, to refuse the bid of 
                            any person, to regulate the bidding and to indicate the highest bidder. If the auctioneer 
                            suspects that a bidder has not made a bona fide bid, or is unable to pay the purchase price 
                            or has not made satisfactory arrangements for payment of the purchase price, he may refuse 
                            to accept the bid of such bidder or accept it provisionally until the bidder has satisfied 
                            him/her that he/ her is in a position to pay the purchase price or that he/ she has made 
                            satisfactory arrangements for payment thereof. On refusal of a bid under such circumstances 
                            the goods may immediately be re-auctioned.

                            severable (removable) from it and will continue in full force and effect unless such 
                            invalidity, unenforceability or illegality goes to the root of these Rules of Auction.
